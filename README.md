# Poker Cheats

Poker Cheats helps poker players make better in game decisions. Users can track table position, hand strength, and betting. Users are shown best in game decisions based on documented poker strategy.


### Working Prototype

View working prototype here: [poker-cheats](https://jacobselbe.github.io/poker-cheats/)


## Technical

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript 
* React

## Development Progress

* Working towards delivering barebones MVP focused on accurately tracking gameplay.


## BASIC MVP - User Stories

**As a user I want to...** 

* see a poker table and buttons to quickly enter game play data
* enter how many players are at the table
* enter new players if they join midgame
* enter which player begins the betting round
* enter my hole cards
* enter board cards as they appear 
* enter each player's actions: call, fold, small raise, large raise
* see the best action I should take between: call, fold, small raise, large raise
* enter my action

**As a user it MAY be helpful to...**

* see my hand strength in addition to recommended actions
* see possible hands that could beat mine
* see the likelihood of possible hands that could beat mine attached to specific players based on their actions


## Next Development Step

* Implementing effective poker strategy into the JavaScript logic. Possibly consider outsourcing this logic to an API if available.
